# DevOps, MLOps & Deployment Guidelines for FinSight

## Containerization Standards

- **Docker Best Practices**: Implement efficient containerization

  - Use multi-stage builds for optimized image sizes
  - Pin base image versions for reproducible builds
  - Create `.dockerignore` files to exclude unnecessary files
  - Implement proper health checks and signal handling
  - Use non-root users for security

- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrate development environments
  - Define complete service stacks with dependencies
  - Use environment-specific override files
  - Include volume mounts for development iteration
  - Implement proper service networking and communication
  - Support both development and production configurations

## CI/CD Pipeline Standards
