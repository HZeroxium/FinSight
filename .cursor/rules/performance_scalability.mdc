# Performance & Scalability Guidelines for FinSight

## Performance Optimization Strategies
- **Async Operations**: Maximize concurrent processing capabilities
  - Use `asyncio.gather()` for parallel I/O operations
  - Implement connection pooling for databases and external APIs
  - Use async context managers for resource management
  - Avoid blocking operations in async contexts

- **Caching Strategies**: Implement multi-level caching
  - Redis for distributed caching across services
  - In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
  - File-based caching for large datasets and models
  - Implement cache invalidation strategies and TTL policies

- **Database Optimization**: Optimize data access patterns
  - Create appropriate indexes for MongoDB queries
  - Use aggregation pipelines for complex data transformations
  - Implement pagination for large result sets
  - Use batch operations for bulk data processing

## Memory Management
- **Large Dataset Handling**: Optimize memory usage for financial data
  - Use generators and iterators for large data processing
  - Implement streaming for continuous data ingestion
  - Use chunked processing for batch operations
  - Monitor memory usage and implement limits

- **Model Serving Optimization**: Efficient ML model deployment
  - Use model quantization for reduced memory footprint
  - Implement model caching and preloading
  - Support multiple serving backends (simple, Triton, TorchServe)
  - Use batch prediction for better throughput

## Scalability Patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design for distributed deployment
  - Use stateless service design for easy scaling
  - Implement proper session management with external stores
  - Support load balancing across multiple instances
  - Use message queues for decoupled service communication

- **Service Decomposition**: Optimize service boundaries
  - Keep services focused on single responsibilities
  - Minimize inter-service communication overhead
  - Use event-driven architecture for loose coupling
  - Implement service discovery and health checking

## Connection Management
- **Database Connections**: Optimize database connectivity
  - Use connection pooling with appropriate pool sizes
  - Implement connection health checks and automatic recovery
  - Monitor connection usage and performance metrics
  - Support connection failover and retry logic

- **External API Management**: Efficiently handle external services
  - Implement rate limiting to respect API quotas
  - Use connection reuse and HTTP/2 where possible
  - Implement circuit breaker patterns for failing services
  - Cache API responses when appropriate

## Monitoring and Metrics
- **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance indicators
  - Monitor response times and throughput
  - Track database query performance
  - Monitor memory and CPU usage
  - Include business metrics (prediction accuracy, data completeness)

- **Bottleneck Identification**: Proactively identify performance issues
  - Use profiling tools for performance analysis
  - Monitor slow queries and expensive operations
  - Track resource utilization trends
  - Implement alerting for performance degradation

## Load Testing and Benchmarking
- **Load Testing Strategy**: Validate system performance under load
  - Test individual services and end-to-end workflows
  - Simulate realistic user behavior and data volumes
  - Include stress testing for failure scenario validation
  - Test auto-scaling behavior and resource limits

- **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish performance baselines
  - Benchmark critical operations and algorithms
  - Compare performance across different implementations
  - Track performance trends over time
  - Include regression testing for performance changes

## Resource Optimization
- **CPU Optimization**: Maximize computational efficiency
  - Use vectorized operations for numerical computations
  - Implement parallel processing for CPU-intensive tasks
  - Optimize algorithm complexity and data structures
  - Use appropriate threading models for different workloads

- **I/O Optimization**: Minimize I/O overhead
  - Batch database operations where possible
  - Use efficient serialization formats (JSON, MessagePack)
  - Implement read replicas for read-heavy workloads
  - Optimize file I/O with appropriate buffer sizes

## Capacity Planning
- **Growth Planning**: Design for future scale
  - Monitor usage trends and growth patterns
  - Plan for peak loads and seasonal variations
  - Implement auto-scaling policies and thresholds
  - Design storage strategies for data growth

- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize resource utilization
  - Right-size service instances for workload requirements
  - Implement resource quotas and limits
  - Monitor resource utilization and costs
  - Support dynamic resource allocation based on demand# Performance & Scalability Guidelines for FinSight
