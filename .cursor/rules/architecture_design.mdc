# Architecture & Design Patterns for FinSight

## Architectural Principles

- Enforce Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) for maximum flexibility
- Implement clear separation of concerns: core business logic, adapters, infrastructure
- Design for testability with dependency injection and interface abstractions
- Create modular, layered architectures with well-defined boundaries
- Follow Domain-Driven Design principles for financial domain modeling

## Core Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

- Abstract data access behind repository interfaces
- Implement multiple storage backends (MongoDB, Redis, CSV, InfluxDB)
- Use repository facades for automatic fallback and switching between implementations
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- Include health monitoring and connection management

### Dependency Injection

- Use `dependency-injector` library for container-based DI
- Create factory functions for service instantiation
- Implement singleton patterns for shared resources (database connections, caches)
- Support configuration-based service selection (file vs Redis repositories)
- Enable easy testing through mock injection

### Factory Pattern

- Create factories for complex object instantiation (models, adapters, services)
- Support multiple implementations through configuration
- Enable runtime switching of implementations
- Include validation and error handling in factory methods
- Provide clear interfaces for factory consumers

### Facade Pattern

- Implement unified facades for complex subsystems (model training, serving, data collection)
- Provide simplified interfaces hiding implementation complexity
- Support initialization, health checking, and graceful shutdown
- Enable seamless switching between underlying implementations
- Include comprehensive error handling and logging

## Service Layer Architecture

- Separate business logic into dedicated service classes
- Keep services focused on single responsibilities
- Implement async service methods for I/O operations
- Use services to orchestrate repository and adapter interactions
- Include comprehensive error handling and transaction management

## API Design Standards

- Follow RESTful conventions with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Implement API versioning strategy (URL path versioning: `/api/v1/`)
- Use consistent error response formats across all endpoints
- Include comprehensive OpenAPI documentation with examples
- Implement proper authentication and authorization patterns

## Data Flow Patterns

- Use message queues (RabbitMQ) for inter-service communication
- Implement event-driven architecture for asynchronous processing
- Create clear data transformation pipelines with validation
- Support batch and streaming data processing patterns
- Include proper error handling and dead letter queues

## Configuration Management

- Use Pydantic Settings for environment-based configuration
- Support multiple environments (development, staging, production)
- Implement configuration validation at startup
- Store sensitive data in environment variables
- Support dynamic configuration reloading where appropriate

## Interface Segregation

- Define clear interfaces for each adapter and service
- Keep interfaces focused and cohesive
- Use abstract base classes for interface definition
- Implement comprehensive interface contracts
- Support multiple implementations per interface# Architecture & Design Patterns for FinSight
